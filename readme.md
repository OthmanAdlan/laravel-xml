(Only for Laravel versions 5.3 and 5.4)

In `config/app.php`

```php
'providers' => array(
    // ...
   Bmatovu\LaravelXml\LaravelXmlServiceProvider::class,
),
```

**Register Alias**

In `config/app.php`

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'Xml' => Bmatovu\LaravelXml\LaravelXml::class,

## Usage...

### Requests

Get the XML payload from the request.

```php
$request->xml();
```

Determine if the request is sending XML.

```php
$request->isXml();
```

Determine if the current request is asking for XML in return.

```php
$request->wantsXml();
```

### Responses

```php
Route::get('/user', function () {
    return response()->xml(['user' => 'John Doe']);
});
```

The snippet above will return

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<document>
    <user>John Doe</user>
</document>
```

With headers having... 

`Content-Type â†’ text/xml; charset=UTF-8`

### Middleware

First register the middleware in `app\Http\Kernel.php`

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'xml' => \Bmatovu\LaravelXml\Http\Middleware\RequireXml::class,
];
```

Then use the middleware on your routes, or in the controllers. 

```php
Route::post('/user/store', function (Request, $request) {
    // do something...
})->middleware('xml');
```

In case of the request is not sending xml, the response will be; [`415` - **Unsupported Media Type**]

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<document>
    <error>Only accepting xml content</error>
</document>
```

### Utilities

**Encode: Array to Xml**

```php
use Xml;

Xml::encode(['key' => 'value']);
```

Or

```php
xml_encode(['key' => 'value']);
```


**Decode: Xml to Array**

```php
use Xml;

Xml::decode('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><document><key>value</key></document>');
```

Or

```php
xml_decode('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><document><key>value</key></document>');
```
